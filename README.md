# Basic Webpack 5 Setup with SASS, Babel, PostCSS, Self-hosted fonts and SVG Sprite

## Description

This repository can be used to build a simple one-page website (i.e not React or equivalent). If you use it you can be sure that:

- Modern Javascript will work on older browsers,
- `.scss` files compile to CSS (usingthe new Dart SASS implementation which allows files to be imported with `@use` and `@forward`, replacing the now deprecated `@import`), and
- the compiled CSS will work on older browsers,
- You will also be able to easily publish the page to Git Pages.

For more information see my [One Page Site Template](https://github.com/chrisnajman/one-page-site-template/tree/main) (GitHub).

**Important**: It is assumed that you have `node.js` installed on your computer.

## webpack.config.js and package.json

### webpack.config.js

Note that by default, the path to the production folder is set as `dist` by default:

- `path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),`.

However, I've changed the output folder to `docs` (which makes publishing to Git Pages much simpler):

- `path: path.resolve(__dirname, "docs"),`.

Also,   

`
  devServer: {
    static: ["./dist"],
  },
  
  
has been changed to:

`
  devServer: {
    static: ["./docs"],
  },
`
### package.json

Similarly, all references in this file to `./dist` have been changed to `./docs`.

## Folder structure

- All development is done inside `src` folder:
- - `src/index.html`
- - `src/js`
- - `src/sass`
- - `src/img`
- - `src/fonts`
- - `src/svg`
- Production files are generated to `docs` folder.
- - Output files in `docs` are all on the same level â€” no folders.
- - - As noted above, the default output folder name, `dist`, has been changed to `docs`.

## Features

- SVG Sprite (optional)
- Self-hosted fonts (optional)



### SASS

Webpack 5's inbuilt SASS package now supports the `@use` and `@forward` instead of `@import`. However, if you don't want
to use this syntax you could either:

- put all `.scss` in `style.scss` (avoiding importing altogether) or
- use the deprecated `@import`. You will get warnings, but the site won't break.

In Dart Sass, `/` for division is deprecated. Use `math.div()`, together with `@use sass:math` instead. See:

- `sass/components/component-test.scss` for a usage example.

## Installation

### Clone repository

In a folder on your computer:

- `git clone git@github.com:chrisnajman/dist-test.git` OR
- `git clone git@github.com:chrisnajman/dist-test.git [new name]` (replacing `[new name]` with the folder name of your choice.)

**Note**: if you're going to upload your completed project to a new GitHub repository:

1. Delete the `.git` folder from the root.
2. Initialise the folder with `git init`.
3. Create the new repository on GitHub.
4. In your local folder:
   1. `git add .`
   2. `git commit -m "First commit"`
   3. `git remote add origin [SSH Url]`
   4. `git push origin master`
5. For Git Pages see "Publishing to Git Pages", below.

## npm commands

Once installed it is advisable to check if all the packages are up to date by running:

- `npm i -g npm-check-updates`

Then, to update `package.json`, run:

- `ncu --upgrade`

Finally, to install updated packages, run:

- `npm i`

### Build commands

A number of build commands can be found in `package.json` under `"scripts"`. I have found that the most useful one is:

- `npm run cbs`

This does three things:

1. It deletes the current `docs` production folder, then
2. builds it again from the `src` folder, then
3. launches a web server on `http://localhost:8080/`.

Once done, any changes made in `src` will automatically update the web browser.

**Note**: the final production files will be in the `docs` folder.

## Publishing to Git Pages

**Important**: make sure to run e.g. `npm run cbs` before pushing to Github.

- `git push origin master`

Then, on the GitHub repository page, click on the 'Settings' tab. From the 'Settings' page, click on 'Pages' in the left hand menu.

- Under 'Branch' select 'main'.
- Under '/(root)' select '/docs'.
- Click 'Save'.

### Publishing to Git Pages from /dist folder

If you decide to change the output folder back to `dist` (as per default `webpack.config`) then you will have to do the following:

**Important**: make sure to run e.g. `npm run cbs` before pushing to Github.

After running `git push origin master`, run:

- `git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages`
